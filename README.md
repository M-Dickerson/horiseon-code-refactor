# <Horiseon-Refractor>

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this was to create a more accessible site for the Horiseon company. The changes made fixes the issues of the images not having alternative texts, as well as streamlining the code for maximum efficancy. I learned a lot about properly organizing and labeling code, as well as changing the applicable css.
